    "text": "Hello! I‚Äôm Yiwei Lu (David), a Business Analytics graduate from UC Irvine with a focus on transforming data into clear, actionable insights. My background spans projects in healthcare, retail, e-commerce, and technology, where I‚Äôve applied tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to support business decisions, optimize operations, and improve user experiences. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, strategy, and communication‚Äîhelping teams understand not just what the numbers say, but what they mean.\nOutside of work, I‚Äôm a curious learner who enjoys exploring tech trends, visual storytelling, and problem-solving challenges. I also love to travel, explore new cultures, and capture moments through photography.
