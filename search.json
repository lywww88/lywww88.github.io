    "text": "Hello! I’m Yiwei Lu (David), a Business Analytics graduate from UC Irvine with a focus on transforming data into clear, actionable insights. My background spans projects in healthcare, retail, e-commerce, and technology, where I’ve applied tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to support business decisions, optimize operations, and improve user experiences. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, strategy, and communication—helping teams understand not just what the numbers say, but what they mean.\nOutside of work, I’m a curious learner who enjoys exploring tech trends, visual storytelling, and problem-solving challenges. I also love to travel, explore new cultures, and capture moments through photography. My free time often includes hiking, snowboarding, badminton, and the occasional adventure off the beaten path—whether it’s trying a new trail or discovering a hidden coffee shop in a new city. Whether in the workplace or beyond, I believe in asking thoughtful questions, staying open-minded, and building connections through shared goals.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Analyst\nJohnson & Johnson — Jan 2025 – Jun 2025\nBusiness Analyst\nCalHome Inc — Oct 2021 – Jul 2024\nConsulting Intern\nFly Media (Shanghai) — May 2019 – Aug 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.S. in Business Analytics, University of California, Irvine (Expected June 2025)\nB.S. in Computer Information Systems, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (May 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages & Tools:\nProficient in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (complex queries, joins, CTEs), R for statistical computing, and SPSS for data analysis.
