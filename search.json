At the outset, we matched J&J‚Äôs transactional sales data with third-party medical databases to enrich customer profiles and validate insights, while also developing exploratory dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to surface initial trends. As the project evolved, the team transitioned to a full-stack approach: SQL for scalable data integration, Python for feature engineering and predictive modeling, and React with Tailwind for an interactive dashboard. This end-to-end solution brought together customer segmentation, churn prediction, and product migration analysis in a single platform, enabling business teams to move seamlessly from data exploration to strategic decision-making.\n\n\n\nKey Outcomes\n\n\n\n\nStrong Predictive Model\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\nFocused Risk Targeting\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Value Creation\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\nRetention Strategy Impact\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\nPredict Customer Churn: Develop models to identify which hospital or account is most at risk of leaving, enabling Johnson & Johnson to prioritize retention actions before revenue is lost.\n\n\nSegment Customer Base: Use clustering to group accounts into meaningful profiles (e.g., High Revenue Contributors, Premium Spenders, Low Engagement) for tailored retention strategies.\n\n\nAnalyze Product Migration: Track shifts from older coils/stents to aspiration systems, revealing physician preferences and informing product portfolio planning.\n\n\nQuantify Financial Impact: Translate predictive accuracy and segmentation insights into projected ROI, linking data science outputs to measurable business value.\n\n\nDeliver Decision-Support Tools: Build interactive dashboards that connect churn predictions, segment profiles, and ROI scenarios, giving managers a clear path from insight to action.\n\n\n\n\n\nData & Features\n\n\n\nTransactional Data Sources: Multi-year sales transaction tables containing FISCAL_YEAR, FISCAL_MONTH, revenue (SALES), product SKU and category, sales channel (distributors, direct), and geographic region. These served as the foundation for all modeling and segmentation.\n\n\nFeature Engineering: Derived business-relevant metrics including:\n\n\nRFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to capture customer behavior patterns.\n\n\nSeasonality features (quarterly and monthly dummy variables) to account for cyclical purchasing behavior.\n\n\nProduct mix ratios to measure migration trends (e.g., coils ‚Üí stents ‚Üí aspiration systems).\n\n\nPricing tiers and discount bands to capture value sensitivity across accounts.\n\n\nRecency windows (e.g., 3-, 6-, 12-month lookbacks) to measure recent activity and inactivity.\n\n\n\n\nData Quality & Standardization: Applied systematic cleaning steps:\n\n\nStandardized product and channel naming across multiple source systems.\n\n\nHandled missing values through imputation and logical rules (e.g., defaulting null channel codes).\n\n\nDetected and capped outliers (e.g., unusually large one-off purchases) to prevent model distortion.\n\n\nCross-source alignment between transactional, regional, and product hierarchy tables to ensure consistency.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Feature Set: Combined raw transactional metrics and engineered variables into a structured dataset ready for churn modeling, clustering, and dashboard integration.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\nData Preparation: Standardized multi-year transactional data (FISCAL_YEAR, FISCAL_MONTH, SALES, SKU, region, channel). Engineered RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value), product mix ratios, migration indicators, and seasonality flags.\n\n\nPredictive Modeling:\n\n\nLogistic Regression as baseline for interpretability and quick benchmarking.\n\n\nXGBoost for high-performance classification, capturing nonlinear interactions and handling imbalanced churn outcomes.\n\n\nRandom Survival Forest (RSF) to estimate time-to-churn, providing survival probabilities over time.\n\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation: Used ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall AUC to measure classification power, C-Index for survival analysis accuracy, and cost-benefit curves to test ROI under different marketing budget constraints.\n\n\nCustomer Segmentation: Applied K-Means clustering on engineered features. Identified distinct groups:\n\n\nPremium Spenders ‚Äì high ticket size, ideal for exclusive offers.\n\n\nPower Buyers ‚Äì frequent purchases, responsive to loyalty programs.\n\n\nLow Engagement ‚Äì low spend and low frequency, requiring reactivation campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nVisualization & Decision Support: Developed interactive dashboards (React + Tailwind + PostgreSQL) to connect predictions with segmentation and campaign planning for Johnson & Johnson managers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Impact\n\n\n\nCustomer Retention: Early identification of high-risk accounts enabled targeted outreach strategies. Our models captured over 60% of churners in the top-risk deciles, ensuring sales teams can focus efforts on the most vulnerable accounts.\n\n\nRevenue Protection: Conservative ROI scenarios projected an annual impact of +$1.2M through optimized retention campaigns, proving that predictive analytics can directly translate into measurable financial value.\n\n\nProduct Migration Insights: Analysis revealed a 45% migration from legacy coils/stents to newer aspiration systems (C71 series). This highlighted evolving physician preferences and informed product portfolio strategy.\n\n\nStrategic Segmentation: Customer clustering uncovered distinct profiles‚ÄîHigh Revenue Contributors, Low Engagement, and Premium Spenders‚Äî giving marketing teams actionable levers for personalized messaging and differentiated retention offers.\n\n\nDecision-Support Tools: Delivered an interactive React + Tailwind + PostgreSQL dashboard that closes the loop (prediction ‚Üí segmentation ‚Üí campaign design ‚Üí monitoring), enabling managers to make real-time, data-driven decisions.\n\n\nLong-term Impact: Established a repeatable data pipeline and modeling workflow that can be extended beyond Cerenovus to other Johnson & Johnson divisions, strengthening enterprise-wide analytics capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo Video\n\n\nWatch a short demo showcasing the interactive dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard\n\n\nBuilt an end-to-end dashboard to visualize churn predictions, customer segments, and retention ROI scenarios.\n\n\n\n Open Dashboard \n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nSelect a deliverable and click ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù:\n\n\n ‚Äì Choose a file ‚Äì Visualization PPT Final PPT Final Report \n Open"
