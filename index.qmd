Hello! I’m **Yiwei Lu**, currently a Master’s candidate in Business Analytics at UC Irvine. I love transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that help organizations make smarter decisions. Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring new machine learning techniques, crafting interactive dashboards, snowboarding down the slopes, or enjoying a scenic bike ride through Southern California.
