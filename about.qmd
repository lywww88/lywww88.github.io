# About this site
This is an about me page that shares who I am, what I do, and where I'm heading next.

## Who am I?

Hi! I'm **Yiwei Lu**, currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at the University of California, Irvine.  
I specialize in using data to tell stories, solve problems, and drive better business decisions.

I’ve worked in both startup and corporate environments, using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and AWS to optimize e-commerce operations, design dashboards, and deploy predictive models.

## What is my Mission?

To bridge the gap between raw data and real-world decisions.  
I strive to uncover hidden patterns, make insights accessible, and build tools that help people make smarter, faster choices.

My goal is to be a strategic data partner in organizations that care about growth, innovation, and user-centric design.
