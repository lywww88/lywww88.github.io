# About Me

Hello! I’m Yiwei Lu (David), a Business Analytics graduate from UC Irvine with a focus on transforming data into clear, actionable insights. My background spans projects in healthcare, retail, e-commerce, and technology, where I’ve applied tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to support business decisions, optimize operations, and improve user experiences. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, strategy, and communication—helping teams understand not just what the numbers say, but what they mean.

Outside of work, I’m a curious learner who enjoys exploring tech trends, visual storytelling, and problem-solving challenges. I also love to travel, explore new cultures, and capture moments through photography. My free time often includes hiking, snowboarding, badminton, and the occasional adventure off the beaten path—whether it’s trying a new trail or discovering a hidden coffee shop in a new city. Whether in the workplace or beyond, I believe in asking thoughtful questions, staying open-minded, and building connections through shared goals.
